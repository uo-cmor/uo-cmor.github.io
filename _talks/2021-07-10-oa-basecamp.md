The [Taupuni Hao Huatau Kaikōiwi Osteoarthritis Basecamp](https://events.otago.ac.nz/2021-osteoarthritis-basecamp/),
organised by CMOR in association with AUT and the University of Auckland, brought together more than 80 clinicians,
researchers, and others with interest in managing osteoarthritis (OA) in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Attendees heard from a series of speakers on innovative health delivery models, clinical programmes, and OA research
in Aotearoa, and contributed to priority-setting for health delivery innovations and osteoarthritis research and to
help shape a recommended Osteoarthritis Strategy and model of care to be presented to government ministers, health
funders, and policymakers at the upcoming Osteoarthritis Summit.

We also thank our partners Arthritis New Zealand, the Maurice & Phyllis Paykel Trust, the New Zealand Rheumatology
Association, and Physiotherapy New Zealand for their ongoing support for this initiative.
