  **Aim**
  Osteoarthritis (OA) affects the wellbeing of one in 10 people in Aotearoa New Zealand, yet current healthcare delivery for these people is fragmented, un-coordinated and inconsistent. How current and future needs should be addressed has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to describe the views of interested people from the health sector regarding current and future OA health service delivery in the public health system in Aotearoa New Zealand.
  
  **Method**
  Data were collected via a co-design approach within an interprofessional workshop at the Taupuni Hao Huatau Kaikoiwi: Osteoarthritis Aotearoa New Zealand Basecamp symposium and analysed using direct qualitative content analysis.

  **Results**
  The results highlighted several promising current healthcare delivery initiatives. Health literacy and obesity prevention policies featured in the thematic analysis suggesting a lifespan or systemwide approach is needed. Data highlighted a need for reformed systems that enhances hauora/wellbeing, promotes physical activity, facilitates interprofessional service delivery and collaborates across care settings.
  
  **Conclusion**
  Participants identified several promising healthcare delivery initiatives for people with OA in Aotearoa New Zealand. Public health policy initiatives are needed to reduce osteoarthritis risk factors. Developing future care pathways should support the diverse needs within Aotearoa New Zealand, coordinate and stratify care, value interprofessional collaboration and practice, and improve health literacy and self-management.
