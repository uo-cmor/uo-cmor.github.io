 **Background**
  In countries with publicly funded health care, there is an increasing need for explicit rationing for total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The Oxford Hip and Knee Scores (OHS/OKS) have been used to set access thresholds for TJA despite not being developed for that purpose. The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative OHS/OKS can aid rationing decisions by investigating the changes in general health-related quality of life after TJA.
  
  **Methods**
  OHS/OKS, Short Form-12, and Short Form-6D (SF-6D) scores were collected preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively in a cohort of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA; n = 713) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA; n = 520). The association between preoperative OHS/OKS and postoperative score and the change in OHS/OKS and SF-6D was investigated, adjusting for age and gender.
  
  **Results**
  The mean Oxford scores improved from 13.9 to 40.7 (OHS) and 15.6 to 37.4 (OKS). The mean SF-6D improved after THA (0.53 to 0.80) and TKA (0.56 to 0.78) (all P < .0001). Poorer preoperative Oxford scores were associated with poorer postoperative OHS/OKS and SF-6D but larger improvements. For every 5 points lower preoperative OHS/OKS, the postoperative SF-6D score was worse by a margin of 0.019 (THA) and 0.023 (TKA).
  
  **Conclusions**
  Preoperative OHS/OKS can help inform rationing decisions. A lower preoperative OHS/OKS will result in greater gains but a lower final outcome score in general health-related quality of life.
