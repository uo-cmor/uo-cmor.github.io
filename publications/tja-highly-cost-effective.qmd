  **Background**
  Total hip and knee arthroplasties (THA/TKA) are clinically effective but high cost procedures. The aim of this study is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of THA and TKA in the New Zealand (NZ) healthcare system.
  
  **Methods**
  Data were collected from 713 patients undergoing THA and 520 patients undergoing TKA at our local public hospital. SF-6D utility values were obtained from participants preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively, and deaths and any revision surgeries from patient records and the New Zealand Joint Registry at minimum 8-year follow-up. A continuous-time state-transition simulation model was used to estimate costs and health gains to 15 years. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine cost effectiveness. ICERs below NZ gross domestic product (GDP; NZ$60 600) and 0.5 times GDP per capita were considered “cost effective” and “highly cost effective” respectively.
  
  **Results**
  Cumulative health gains were 2.8 QALYs (THA) and 2.3 QALYs (TKA) over 15 years. Cost effectiveness improved from ICERs of NZ$74,400 (THA) and NZ$93,000 (TKA) at 1 year to NZ$6000 (THA) and NZ$7500 (TKA) at 15 years. THA and TKA were cost effective after 2 years and highly cost effective after 3 years. QALY gains and cost effectiveness were greater in patients with worse preoperative functional status and younger age.
  
  **Conclusion**
  THA and TKA are highly cost-effective procedures over longer term horizons. Although preoperative status and age were associated with cost effectiveness, both THA and TKA remained cost effective in patients with less severe preoperative scores and older ages.
