The Centre for Musculoskeletal Outcomes Research (CMOR) aims to conduct and disseminate research addressing decision-making and outcomes for patients with musculoskeletal disorders.

CMOR is a multidisciplinary community of researchers, clinicians, policy makers and educators dedicated to improving patient health outcomes. We do this through research across the spectrum of clinical epidemiology and outcomes research, including epidemiology, clinical trials, health economics, implementation, evaluation and health services research.

About us
------
CMOR is a research centre within the University of Otago, located within the Orthopaedic section, Department of Surgical Sciences, Dunedin School of Medicine, and strongly affiliated with clinical services of the Southern District Health Board (Dunedin Hospital and associated centres). However, its membership is not restricted by location or affiliation. CMOR draws associate members from a broad range of disciplines, from organisations locally, nationally and internationally. Our members are active in a range of productive international collaborations.

CMOR provides expert skills and research training in the fields of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal health technologies and service delivery.

Our research portfolios include outcome measure evaluation, occupational and public health issues, clinical epidemiology, economic evaluations and health resource allocation issues affecting primary and secondary care settings.
