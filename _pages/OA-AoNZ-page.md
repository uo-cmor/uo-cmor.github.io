The Osteoarthritis Summit Kaupapa
The purpose of the Aotearoa New Zealand Osteoarthritis Summit initiative is to facilitate strategic planning for a national response to the growing burden of OA and its consequences, and to galvanise action on addressing this. It takes inspiration from the successful series of Osteoarthritis Summits in Australia, led by prominent rheumatologist and world-leading OA expert Professor David Hunter.
The key objectives of our kaupapa are as follows.
    1. To develop a prioritised list of national priorities in osteoarthritis research and innovative health delivery:
        i. Identify research and innovative health delivery priorities for the next three to five years that offer the greatest potential benefit for alleviating the burden of OA.
        ii. Identify research and innovative health delivery priorities that match the strengths and expertise of the Aotearoa New Zealand OA research community to achieve the goals under Objective 1.
        iii. Identify multidisciplinary initiatives and strategies to advance OA research and innovative health delivery into agreed priority areas
        iv. Connect the OA research and innovative health delivery community, foster increased collaboration in OA research and innovative health delivery in Aotearoa New Zealand, and facilitate a cohesive approach to OA research and innovative health delivery in Aotearoa New Zealand from basic science to translational research and implementation by forming an OA research network and facilitating interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration.
    2. To co-create a national Model of Care for Osteoarthritis. 
Toward this objective we will:
        i. Develop and promote a mission statement for the kaupapa/initiative, exemplifying the best care for people with OA in Aotearoa New Zealand.
        ii. Advance the development of equity in clinical services, research, and policy development and ensure collaboration with Māori at every level (clinical service development and implementation, research and policy).
        iii. Promote advocacy and policy change that improves care delivery and quality of life for people living with OA in Aotearoa New Zealand.
        iv. Connect clinical service providers to build interdisciplinary collaboration and facilitate consistent best practice care from DHBs and Private Health providers.

This national OA Research Network aims to:
1) Progress research excellence across the spectrum of research contributing to new knowledge relevant to osteoarthritis.
2) Extend research strength in Aotearoa New Zealand by advancing OA research and facilitating national and international collaboration.
3) Build capability and capacity in OA research by supporting research training and early- and mid-career development of the OA research workforce.

Current initiatives:
1) Developing a Consumer, Patient & Public Partnership Panel
2) Developing an Early- and Mid-Career Researcher (EMCR) support network 
3) Providing continuing researcher development short-course and webinar opportunities.
