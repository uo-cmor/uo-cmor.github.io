# Reducing the burden of osteoarthritis in Aotearoa New Zealand

# Summary of Research Project

Osteoarthritis is among the most common long-term conditions in New Zealand. The burden of pain, disability and economic costs is rising – especially for Māori. Access to treatments is poor. Joint replacement surgery is highly cost-effective, but demand – already straining capacity – is growing rapidly. Cost-effective interventions for early- and mid-stage osteoarthritis are known to have good outcomes and are potentially cost-saving compared to current practice, but are not being delivered. Multimorbidity is common. Coping with future demand will require optimising resource allocation; we must consider preventive measures and coordinated delivery of accessible, equitable, effective and cost-effective interventions. This programme of research of four linked multi-disciplinary projects will look at ways to deliver the best value for money and equity in managing osteoarthritis in the New Zealand public healthcare system, from prevention through to joint replacement surgery.

**A Cohesive, Collaborative Programme of Four Inter-related Projects**

<img src="/images/Programme hands.jpg" class=center />

**The Programme aims to address the following key issues:**

## 1. Allocative Efficiency 

The allocative efficiency of intervention delivery across the disease course of OA, including health economic evaluation, population-based data analyses, equity analysis and computer simulation modelling.  

## 2. Filling gaps in OA knowledge

Filling knowledge gaps regarding health losses, economic consequences, inequities, and treatment effects in pre- and early OA, and peri-surgical end-stage OA (Projects 2, 3 & 4).

## 5. Collaborative Development

With a particular focus on achieving Māori uptake and engagement, and clinical trial evaluation of a novel intervention programme for multimorbidity including OA – a key area of unmet need and knowledge gap.

## 6. Matauranga

Each project has a distinct rangahau Māori thread, led and conducted by kairangahau Māori, and a capstone project using a critical Māori lens to examine the intersections and implications of each project and the overall results of this Programme and of HRC-funded Project 21-526 “Measuring the health state preferences of New Zealanders” (an investigation of equitable measurement of health-related quality of life in Aotearoa  and the impact of common LTCs). The Programme will be conducted with oversight by a taumata of Kairangahau Māori, who will have rangatiratanga (the right to exercise leadership and authority) over the interpretation, knowledge transfer and impact activities of the results of these threads and their meaning in and for the wider context of Māori health advancement and equity in health delivery.
