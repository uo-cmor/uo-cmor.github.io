    "text": "Research questions\nDoes a novel, culturally acceptable exercise therapy, dietary education, and self-management intervention, in addition to usual care, result in superior self-reported and objectively measured physical and physiological outcomes in people with multimorbidity, compared with usual care only? Is it cost-effective? What are the equity consequences? Project 3 will provide data to Proj. 1 & 4.\n\n\nBackground\nThis project focuses on multimorbidity. Multimorbidity affects &gt;42% of Aotearoa peoples over age 45, with Māori and Pasifika disproportionately affected. Physical activity has positive effects on at least 26 LTCs including cardiovascular disease, T2D, COPD, depression and health outcomes in overweight and obesity, however the pain and disability of OA is a barrier to physical activity. Exercise therapy supported by patient education is effective in overcoming that barrier. The high prevalence of multimorbidity in Māori and Pacific patients requires the health system reorientate health-care delivery around multimorbidity, and deliver culturally safe lifestyle interventions. Multimorbidity in which OA is one condition is termed OA and comorbidity.\nThis project builds on the previous research of the investigator team. The unique contribution of this Aotearoa project is our focus on people with OA and comorbidity, and adapting interventions to the unique Aotearoa context.\nPI Abbott’s group have conducted extensive stakeholder research on the preferences and priorities of a cross-section of stakeholders in the treatment of OA. We conducted focus groups with people with OA (n=11), Māori (n=5), policymakers (national & local healthcare delivery) (n=7), healthcare providers (n=10), and OA experts (n=5). This revealed that presence of co-morbid conditions, attitudes and beliefs, culturally safe practices, social support factors, and accessibility were among the key themes important to stakeholders.\nNI Skou’s team has to date completed a series of focus group interview projects, co-development of an intervention programme with people with multimorbidity and health care providers, a feasibility study (manuscripts in preparation), and a qualitative study nested within the programme feasibility trial aimed to investigate participants’ and health care providers experiences with the exercise and self-management intervention developed by NI Skou’s team, and assess intervention acceptability.\nNI Coppell’s team have conducted a non-randomised 6-month comparative feasibility trial of a dietary-focussed weight loss programme in patients with prediabetes, with economic evaluation, in Hawke’s Bay funded by the MoH, Hawke’s Bay Medical Research Foundation and the NZ Society for the Study of Diabetes. The feasibility of implementing the novel nurse-delivered Prediabetes Intervention Package (PIP) within the primary care setting, in patients with recently diagnosed prediabetes, was shown, and intervention fidelity was shown to be very good. The study enrolled eight general practices in the Napier-Hastings region, recruiting 172 with prediabetes and overweight or obesity. Patient interviews (9 men and 10 women, comprising of 8 Māori, 2 Pacific and 9 non-Māori non-Pacific), indicated the intervention was very well received . A current HRC funded (16/344) follow-up study uses the same intervention but with additional follow-up support, providing valuable feasibility, process and implementation insights. The project also established feasibility of cost-effectiveness analysis from a health service perspective. Strong engagement with all intervention practice nurses was established.\n\n\nDesign and methods\nThis project will use a 4-phase approach: 1) co-refinement of intervention with ethnically diverse Aotearoa context; 2) pilot study; 3) randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation and process evaluation; and 4) implementation toolkit production. We will develop an exercise therapy and education program based on MOBILIZE and existing recommendations for exercise, diet, lifestyle change, and strategies to facilitate behavioural changes. The lifestyle education will incorporate the PIP in its entirety (i.e. 1x 30 minute and 5x 15 minute dietary assessment and goal setting sessions) provided by a trained practice nurse experienced in the intervention (NI Tangiora), and guidelines-informed healthy lifestyle education and self-management sessions. The exercise therapy protocols, proven effective in the MOA Trial, include aerobic, strength, agility, and flexibility, will be provided by Māori physiotherapists. The exercise therapy has been specifically designed to use minimal equipment, be readily delivered in outpatient or primary care settings and transferable to home use. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration and a high degree of patient involvement throughout the entire research process are at the heart of the project to ensure relevance to patients and the health care system and to make sure that the project is implementable in clinical practice. A core design focus is to optimise the uptake of the programme within culturally diverse health care settings.\nIn Phase 1 we will co-develop, with an ethnically diverse sample of stakeholders, the content and format of the intervention building on the extensive development phases of the MOBILIZE, MOA and PIP studies. Using a qualitative and Mātauranga Māori approach, interviews will be conducted with patients and their whānau with OA and comorbidity, healthcare consumers and providers, to determine their preferences and expectations. In the event of COVID restrictions, we will either delay up to 6 months or recruit fully vaccinated.\nIn Phase 2 we will recruit and interview patients and whānau with multimorbidity meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria (below) in a pilot study of all aspects of the full trial protocol below. Semi-structured interviews will explore the challenges and benefits of the programme, preferences for delivery, barriers and facilitators of access and adherence. Qualitative research will use culturally aligned approaches, sampling improved, not-improved, male, female, Māori, and non-Māori (n=30).\nPhase 3 is a randomized trial with process evaluation and economic evaluation. The study hypothesis is that the personalized exercise therapy and lifestyle education program will result in superior HRQoL (primary), physical function, and cardiovascular risk factors (including glycated haemoglobin HbA1c), and will be cost-effective from health system and societal perspectives compared with usual care. Usual care is the ideal comparison for establishing incremental effects over status quo health delivery, and for evaluation of cost-effectiveness of implementation. All healthcare consumption in both groups is measured using the Otago Costs and Consequences Questionnaire.\nParticipants with OA and co-morbidity (i.e. multimorbidity) will be recruited through Health Hawkes Bay practices and Hastings Hospital orthopaedic outpatients and randomly assigned to either the supported exercise therapy and education programme or usual care\nInclusion criteria: adults aged 35-70 meeting the NICE clinical diagnostic criteria for OA and at least one of the following: T2D or prediabetes, heart disease (heart failure or coronary heart disease), hypertension, COPD, or depression. Having other comorbidities does not exclude participation. Exclusion criteria: Participation in supervised systematic exercise for one of their diseases within the last 3 months; Patients with: an unstable health condition or at risk of serious adverse events; with life expectancy of less than 12 months; with psychosis disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, anorexia nervosa/bulimia nervosa or with an illness related to substance or alcohol abuse; not independently mobile in the community, not willing or available to participate for the intervention duration; or unable to comprehend the recruitment or intervention processes.\nImplementation will be conducted and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and He Pikinga Waiora Implementation Framework (HPWIF)153, 154. The process evaluation will comply with best-practice guidance using qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods for analysis of outcome measures in which several NIs have expertise. The CFIR is a pragmatic structure for evaluating implementation research, that has been widely used to inform such evaluations including those similar to MOBILIZE. The HPWIF is a tool designed to improve the uptake of prevention and treatment programmes within culturally diverse health care settings, aimed at reducing health inequities and achieving health equity for Māori. The HPWIF is a 62-item tool that utilizes in-depth interviews and online surveys in the domains of cultural-centeredness, community engagement, systems thinking, and integrated knowledge translation to assess and inform successful future implementation. Mixed-methods framework analysis will be based in a Kaupapa Māori theoretical grounding.\nTo ensure the highest quality trial design, we have submitted our proposal to ANZMUSC peer-review for endorsement. We will register the trial on www.ANZCTR.org.au and publish full protocol details on https://OSF.io We will report the results using CONSORT (+ extensions) and CHEERS standards.\nPhase 4: Should the trial results be positive; we will develop training and implementation resources and impact activities to support uptake at scale across other settings (an implementation toolkit). This proposal responds to Priorities 5 and 6 of the Academy of Medical Sciences priorities for multimorbidity (develop tools and deploy strategies).\n\n\nResearch team\nCoppell, Abbott, Skou, Wilson, Bell (kairangahau Māori), Brooking (kairangahau Māori), Tangiora (kairangahau Māori), Wawatai-Aldrich (kairangahau Māori), Bennell.\nKey relationships: Health Hawkes Bay, Cape Physio Māori Physiotherapists Leah Tuhi, Blake Taylor, Judy Brown; Consumer Advisory Group, Māori Advisory Group (kairangahau Māori above, Cape Physio cultural liaison Brenda Wainohu, locally recruited Māori representatives)."

    "text": "Research questions\nWhat are the long-term impacts of ligament injury?\n\n\nDesign and methods\nThis study will investigate the long-term impacts of ligament injury, including the risk of early-onset knee OA, using data from the IDI on all ligament injury claims made to ACC, equity of subsequent health and economic outcomes, including OA diagnosis data from primary care drawn from our current HRC-funded project (18/442). The IDI-based analyses will use matching methods to construct cohorts of similar individuals varying only in the treatment/exposure of interest (ligament injury, opioid prescribing). By using the whole-of-population datasets and extensive linked data available in the IDI, we will have sufficient data to construct high-quality matching between ‘case’ and ‘control’ groups, and will follow established best practices in the construction, diagnostic testing, and refinement of these matching models. Outcomes will be compared between the matched cohorts using standard methods such as linear, logistic, and survival models. Analyses will also be stratified by age, gender, and ethnicity (and the matching models constructed to support these subgroup analyses) to identify groups at high risk of inequitable outcomes. These analyses will all build on existing projects currently underway, including an HRC-funded Health Delivery Research grant (20/1164) for analysis of the ligament injury data and Otago Medical Research Foundation- and H.S & J.C Anderson Trust-funded research on opioid use around TJR. The IDI is unique and world-leading in the extent of linked individual-level, population-wide data available, allowing us to provide data and results of international significance.\n\n\nResearch team:\nAbbott (project leadership), Pryymachenko (data analysis expertise, esp. IDI); Wilson (advice on statistical analysis, IDI expertise, and simulation model inputs); Ligament injuries: Whittaker, Young; Kairangahau Māori rōpū, equity analyses interpretation: Mutu-Grigg, Kidd, Bell."

    "text": "HRC Programme grant 2022–2027\n\nReducing the burden of osteoarthritis in Aotearoa New Zealand\nOsteoarthritis is among the most common long-term conditions in New Zealand. The burden of pain, disability and economic costs is rising – especially for Māori. Access to treatments is poor. Joint replacement surgery is highly cost-effective, but demand – already straining capacity – is growing rapidly. Cost-effective interventions for early- and mid-stage osteoarthritis are known to have good outcomes and are potentially cost-saving compared to current practice, but are not being delivered. Multimorbidity is common. Coping with future demand will require optimising resource allocation; we must consider preventive measures and coordinated delivery of accessible, equitable, effective and cost-effective interventions. This programme of research of four linked multi-disciplinary projects will look at ways to deliver the best value for money and equity in managing osteoarthritis in the New Zealand public healthcare system, from prevention through to joint replacement surgery.\nFor more information on this research programme and the projects underway, please see here."

    "text": "Aims\n\nTo provide kaitiakitanga over the data and also act as a korowai for hapū and whānau to ensure that the research will advance the recommendations of WAI 2575 stage one and inform future stages.\nTo apply a critical Māori lens to the intersections and implications of this programme and of HRC-funded Project 21-526 “Measuring the health state preferences of New Zealanders” (an investigation of equitable measurement of health-related quality of life in Aotearoa and the impact of common long-term conditions).\nTo develop mātauranga findings and outputs that are expressly relevant to whānau and hapū, to rangahau Māori, to Māori health professionals, and to the Waitangi Tribunal Wai 2575 Inquiry stages two and three.\n\n\n\nBackground\nThe Waitangi Tribunal Hauora report (Wai 2575, 2019) identified and prioritised themes of systemic failure in health services and outcomes. The Waitangi Tribunal found, in Wai 2575 (2019), “that appropriate measuring of, and reporting on, Māori health inequities needs to be a key accountability mechanism in the health secto”” (p122) and that “the Crown’s failure to institute mechanisms that ensure that Māori health outcomes are measured and reported on in a robust way undermines the ability of the system to improve the design and delivery of Māori health care. This, in turn, impacts on the way that Māori experience and receive care.” (8.5, p.152).\nThis programme seeks to align with and address the key findings of the Stage One WAI 2575 report, i.e. alignment with the articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi; emphasising Māori authority (tino rangatiratanga); strengthening accountability mechanisms; targeted and equitable investment in Māori health; and embedding equity and anti-racism in approaches to OA.\n\n\nDesign and methods\nProject 4 will amplify and build on the equity focus of projects 1-3 in three ways. Firstly, it will provide kaitiakitanga over the whole programme, including ensuring the principles of Indigenous data sovereignty are upheld. Further, this project will make explicit the way the programme findings can advance the recommendations of stage one of the WAI 2575 hauora hearings and provide evidence about the management of OA for stages two and three of the hearings.\nSecondly, this project will apply a critical Māori lens, grounded in the work of Pihama and Tuhiwai Smith, to the findings from the Programme. This targeted analysis will result in culturally specific framings for the findings and outputs, and inform a report on the equity of access, resource allocation, and outcomes of OA for submission to the Waitangi Tribunal.\nFinally, Project 4 will draw on the data from the whole programme to develop mātauranga findings and outcomes. These findings will originate with te ao Māori, and will be focused on whānau, hapū and iwi hauora and oranga aspirations and ways of knowing. The rōpū kairangahau will provide direction and recommendations to each Project throughout the duration of the programme to optimise achievement of the 3 aims stated for this project.\n\n\nResearch team\nKidd (lead); Mutu-Grigg (projects 1, 2); Bell, Tangiora, Wawatai-Aldrich, Brooking (project 3); and Dixon (project 4). Smiler and Brooking will join this project in kaitiaki roles, with Smiler and Bell also bringing knowledge from project 21/526 to this project."

The OA Research Network Conference (17 November 2022) brought together international and national researchers to present and discuss current OA research, facilitate collaboration, and plan how future research can contribute to achieving an OA Strategy for Aotearoa New Zealand.\nThe Osteoarthritis Aotearoa New Zealand (OAAoNZ) 2022 Summit built on the foundations laid by the inaugural Osteoarthritis Aotearoa New Zealand Basecamp in July 2021 to continue our work to co-create a national Model of Care for osteoarthritis care in Aotearoa New Zealand, and to develop a list of national priorities in osteoarthritis research to support these aims. The Summit brought together researchers with leaders from government, Te Whatu Ora Health NZ, Te Aka Whai Ora Māori Health Authority, colleagues involved in primary care, secondary and tertiary care services, healthcare commissioning and research funding, and consumers living with OA. Presentations covered issues and themes such as considering Te Tiriti o Waitangi when designing OA services, challenges and opportunities in relation to managing weight, a Te Ao Māori approach in primary care, and the role GPs play in OA management. Attendees also heard panel discussions focusing on priorities for public and patient partnership and equitable health delivery innovation for people with OA and culturally responsive models of care for the management of OA.\nWe thank our partners Arthritis New Zealand, Victoria University of Wellington, the Maurice & Phyllis Paykel Trust, Össur, Physiotherapy New Zealand, and AUT for their ongoing support for this initiative."

By using the whole-of-population datasets and extensive linked data available in the IDI, we will have sufficient data to construct high-quality matching between ‘case’ and ‘control’ groups, and will follow established best practices in the construction, diagnostic testing, and refinement of these matching models. Outcomes will be compared between the matched cohorts using standard methods such as linear, logistic, and survival models. Analyses will also be stratified by age, gender, and ethnicity (and the matching models constructed to support these subgroup analyses) to identify groups at high risk of inequitable outcomes. These analyses will all build on existing projects currently underway, including an HRC-funded Health Delivery Research grant (20/1164) for analysis of the ligament injury data and Otago Medical Research Foundation- and H.S & J.C Anderson Trust-funded research on opioid use around TJR.

    "text": "Research questions\nThis project will evaluate the allocative efficiency and equity consequence of varying the funding mix and treatment provision for preventive, early-, mid-, and late-stage OA interventions. Specific research questions will include: What is the cost-effectiveness of ligament injury prevention strategies to reduce early OA incidence? What is the cost-effectiveness of delivering co-ordinated care and core interventions in the public health system? What is the cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce the use of opioids before and after TJR? What is the cost-effectiveness of varying the disease stage and symptom profile at which TJR is offered? What mix of these competing investments gleans the greatest benefits and equity gains? The Project will respond to WAI 2575 and provide data to Project 4.\n\n\nDesign and methods\nWe will develop and validate a computer simulation model of hip and knee OA incidence and progression, symptoms, healthcare and economic costs, and treatment pathways, building on the skills, expertise, and codebase developed in our recent HRC-funded project (15/263) in which we developed and applied a new simulation model (the NZ-MOA model) for knee OA. We have used the NZ-MOA model for several completed and in-progress studies within our projects HRC 15/263 and 18/442, including an estimate of the lifetime health losses attributable to knee OA in Aotearoa, the future healthcare costs and demand for joint replacement, the lifetime cost-effectiveness of multiple early- and mid-stage knee OA interventions, and a programme evaluation for the Ministry of Health (MoH).\nThe state-transition design of the NZ-MOA model is well-suited to evaluating the costs and effects of interventions over time, but is not suitable for evaluating the allocative efficiency of varying the funding mix across the disease course. Addressing these crucial questions requires a novel model structure able to capture changes in capacity constraints across the health sector associated with different funding allocations. We will therefore develop for this project a new model, based on a discrete event simulation (DES) framework, that is explicitly designed to incorporate capacity constraints and resource allocation across the health sector. A recent systematic review of models used in economic evaluation for OA found that the vast majority were simple decision-tree models or Markov state-transition models that are similarly unable to evaluate resource allocation across the disease course. Previous work by NI Marshall identified an absence of research modelling resource use requirements, constraints, and allocative efficiency. Our proposed research will therefore be leading edge internationally.\nIn brief, a DES model consists of a population of hypothetical simulated individuals, each with attributes (e.g. age, sex, disease state); a set of health events, such as disease incidence, initiation of treatment, or occurrence of adverse events, that can happen to the individuals; resources such as healthcare facilities or workers required to process, for example, patients undergoing a particular treatment; and the flow of time over which individuals enter the model, events occur, and outcomes are measured. This provides a flexible and powerful way to simulate clinical reality across the course of a disease.\nAn advantage of the DES framework is the model transparency afforded by the ability to follow individuals’ and groups’ disease course and clinical pathways through the model, along with the decision criteria and probability distributions applied at each step. This allows rigorous evaluation of the face validity of the model structure, assumptions, and input data, including by non-technical reviewers. This will give end-users and decision-makers confidence in our modelling methods, outputs, and recommendations to support translation, uptake, and impact.\nFitting a realistic DES model requires a wealth of data to inform the key relationships between patient attributes, event occurrence, and resulting outcomes. In this project we will bring together a range of existing data and modelling resources, including the world-leading linked individual-level, population-wide data available in the Statistics NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI); existing data from national population datasets; modelling expertise; data and results from our previous HRC-funded projects (07/199, 07/200, 11/124, 15/263, 18/442) and current project (21/526); and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intervention effectiveness. The research conducted in Project 2 will build on these existing resources and data to fill key knowledge gaps and provide additional required model inputs. Model structure, input data, and outputs will be rigorously validated (face, internal, external, predictive) using established best-practice methodology, including cross-model validity. Equity will be a core consideration in model design, inputs, and analyses.\nThe model will be used to evaluate the healthcare and societal costs and HRQoL outcomes, at the population level, of various strategies for the prevention or management of OA throughout the disease course. These are evaluated by running the same simulated population cohort through alternative intervention scenarios, each involving different funding allocations or treatment pathways for individuals with OA. The lifetime population healthcare and societal costs and HRQoL outcomes will be compared across the different scenarios to evaluate intervention cost-effectiveness. An advantage of individual-level simulation models is the ability to run equity analyses on sub-populations, such as Māori, to identify scenarios that offer the greatest equity gains (i.e. strongest potential to reduce disparities).\n\n\nResearch team\nWilson (simulation modelling), Abbott (project leadership), Pryymachenko (IDI data analysis expertise); Schofield, Marshall & Clarke (simulation modelling and health economic analyses), Kairangahau Māori rōpū (Mutu-Grigg, Kidd, Bell: advice on equity analyses and interpretation), Whittaker (advice on injury prevention and treatment intervention outcomes), Stokes (advice primary care, interface with secondary care, and health systems implications, network, dissemination and impact activities)."

    "text": "Research questions\nWhat is the cost-effectiveness of TJR in the Aotearoa health system? How does the cost-effectiveness of TJR vary by disease stage, patient characteristics, and symptom profile at surgery? Is TJR delivered equitably in Aotearoa?\n\n\nDesign and methods\n\nCost-effectiveness of TJR\nJoint replacement surgery dominates the public health system costs for OA. It is highly effective and cost-effective, but exactly when it is best offered is not known. This project will investigate the cost-effectiveness of TJR surgery at differing levels of severity, using our data collected from patients undergoing TJR at Dunedin Hospital. The analysis will use a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design. RD designs are a powerful method to estimate causal, quasi-experimental treatment effects from non-random allocation, by exploiting arbitrary treatment allocation rules in real-world settings. Due to increasing demand and limited capacity, access to TJR in the public healthcare sector is rationed in Aotearoa. At first specialist assessment, patients are evaluated using the NZ Orthopaedic Association Prioritisation Tool. A threshold Prioritisation Tool score (varying over time to reflect shifts in supply and demand) is used to determine eligibility for surgery: patients scoring above the threshold are considered for surgery, while those falling below are referred back to their GP for ongoing non-surgical management. As access is determined by local health system capacity to deliver surgery within prescribed waiting times, patients scoring just above and just below the threshold are otherwise similar and would both be expected to gain from surgery. The fuzzy RD design exploits the discontinuity in the likelihood of being offered surgery around the threshold value to identify the causal effect of TJR despite the non-random allocation of patients to surgical and non-surgical treatment. HRQoL and treatment costs over up to two years post-operatively will be estimated to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of surgical versus non-surgical management for these patients. This will be a unique study in the field.\n\n\nEquity of access to joint replacement surgery\nWe have previously described the equity of access to hip and knee TJR surgery in the public health system from 2006–2013 using the MoH’s National Minimum Dataset (NMDS), and projected total knee replacement surgery rates (Māori, non-Māori) to 2038 using the NZ Joint Registry (NZJR). While we found no inequity of access for Māori, non-urban, and more deprived subpopulations in the public health system, this does not provide the complete picture required for accurate modelling and equity analyses, as it fails to capture TJR provided by ACC and the private sector. We will overcome that limitation by leveraging two world-leading Aotearoa data resources: the NZJR and the IDI. We aim to link NZJR data with the IDI, and replicate the methods described in our earlier research110. Linking the important NZJR data resource would be a significant contribution to research capability in Aotearoa using the IDI. We have engaged with the Board of the NZJR and StatsNZ (Sept. 2021); should linking not be possible we will again use the MoH NMDS data and NZJR data directly, which is possible but with limitations of weaker ethnicity data, greater uncertainty in subpopulation identification, and blends ACC with private sector funded TJRs. This project will be led by Orthopaedic Surgeons Dr John Mutu-Grigg (Ngati Kahu, Te Rarawa) and Dr Simon Young (NZ Joint Registry Board member) as NZJR liaison.\n\n\n\nResearch team\nAbbott (project leadership), Pryymachenko (data analysis expertise, esp. IDI); Wilson (advice on statistical analysis, IDI expertise, and simulation model inputs); Joint replacement surgeries: Mutu-Grigg, Choong, Gwynne-Jones, Young, Dowsey; Kairangahau Māori rōpū, equity analyses interpretation: Mutu-Grigg, Kidd, Bell."

RD designs are a powerful method to estimate causal, quasi-experimental treatment effects from non-random allocation, by exploiting arbitrary treatment allocation rules in real-world settings. Due to increasing demand and limited capacity, access to TJR in the public healthcare sector is rationed in Aotearoa. At first specialist assessment, patients are evaluated using the NZ Orthopaedic Association Prioritisation Tool. A threshold Prioritisation Tool score (varying over time to reflect shifts in supply and demand) is used to determine eligibility for surgery: patients scoring above the threshold are considered for surgery, while those falling below are referred back to their GP for ongoing non-surgical management. As access is determined by local health system capacity to deliver surgery within prescribed waiting times, patients scoring just above and just below the threshold are otherwise similar and would both be expected to gain from surgery. The fuzzy RD design exploits the discontinuity in the likelihood of being offered surgery around the threshold value to identify the causal effect of TJR despite the non-random allocation of patients to surgical and non-surgical treatment. HRQoL and treatment costs over up to two years post-operatively will be estimated to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of surgical versus non-surgical management for these patients. This will be a unique study in the field.\n\n\nEquity of access to joint replacement surgery\nWe have previously described the equity of access to hip and knee TJR surgery in the public health system from 2006–2013 using the MoH’s National Minimum Dataset (NMDS), and projected total knee replacement surgery rates (Māori, non-Māori) to 2038 using the NZ Joint Registry (NZJR). While we found no inequity of access for Māori, non-urban, and more deprived subpopulations in the public health system, this does not provide the complete picture required for accurate modelling and equity analyses, as it fails to capture TJR provided by ACC and the private sector. We will overcome that limitation by leveraging two world-leading Aotearoa data resources: the NZJR and the IDI. We aim to link NZJR data with the IDI, and replicate the methods described in our earlier research110. Linking the important NZJR data resource would be a significant contribution to research capability in Aotearoa using the IDI. We have engaged with the Board of the NZJR and StatsNZ (Sept. 2021); should linking not be possible we will again use the MoH NMDS data and NZJR data directly, which is possible but with limitations of weaker ethnicity data, greater uncertainty in subpopulation identification, and blends ACC with private sector funded TJRs. This project will be led by Orthopaedic Surgeons Dr John Mutu-Grigg (Ngati Kahu, Te Rarawa) and Dr Simon Young (NZ Joint Registry Board member) as NZJR liaison.\n\n\n\nResearch team\nAbbott (project leadership), Pryymachenko (data analysis expertise, esp. IDI); Wilson (advice on statistical analysis, IDI expertise, and simulation model inputs); Joint replacement surgeries: Mutu-Grigg, Choong, Gwynne-Jones, Young, Dowsey; Kairangahau Māori rōpū, equity analyses interpretation: Mutu-Grigg, Kidd, Bell."

    "text": "Summary of Research Project\nOsteoarthritis is among the most common long-term conditions in New Zealand. The burden of pain, disability and economic costs is rising – especially for Māori. Access to treatments is poor. Joint replacement surgery is highly cost-effective, but demand – already straining capacity – is growing rapidly. Cost-effective interventions for early- and mid-stage osteoarthritis are known to have good outcomes and are potentially cost-saving compared to current practice, but are not being delivered. Multimorbidity is common. Coping with future demand will require optimising resource allocation; we must consider preventive measures and coordinated delivery of accessible, equitable, effective and cost-effective interventions. This programme of research of four linked multi-disciplinary projects will look at ways to deliver the best value for money and equity in managing osteoarthritis in the New Zealand public healthcare system, from prevention through to joint replacement surgery.\n\n\n\nA Cohesive, Collaborative Programme of Four Inter-related Projects\n\n\n\nThe programme aims to address the following key issues:\n\n1. Allocative Efficiency\nThe allocative efficiency of intervention delivery across the disease course of OA, including health economic evaluation, population-based data analyses, equity analysis and computer simulation modelling.\n\n2. Risks, Impacts, Equity, and Cost-Effectiveness\nComputer simulation modelling requires detailed input data describing the key relationships between patient attributes, event occurrence, and the cost and effects outcomes associated with disease states and interventions. In addition to data already used to provide inputs for our existing NZ-MOA simulation model, past HRC-funded projects, published results from the epidemiological literature, and findings from other projects within the Programme, we will conduct additional empirical and epidemiological studies to provide necessary input data for modelling work.\n\n3. He Oranga mō te whanau\nImproving outcomes for people with hip and knee OA and comorbidities.\n\n4. Mātauranga\nA mātauranga approach to access, resourcing, and outcomes for Māori with OA."
